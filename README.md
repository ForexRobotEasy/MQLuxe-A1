## How It Works

### Include necessary libraries
The code includes the necessary libraries for performing trades and calculating indicators.

### Define input parameters
The code defines various input parameters such as lot size, stop loss, take profit, and indicator periods.

### Define global variables
Global variables are defined to store indicator values and trading signals.

### Create indicator instances
Instances of the ATR and RSI indicators are created using the respective classes.

### Initialize the robot
The OnInit() function is called during initialization. It calculates the initial values of the ATR and RSI indicators.

### Execute trading logic
The OnTick() function is called on each tick. It recalculates the ATR and RSI values and checks if the ATR value is greater than the stop loss. If it is, the function adjusts the stop loss and take profit levels based on the ATR value. It then executes a buy trade if the RSI is oversold, or a sell trade if the RSI is overbought.

### Handle trade events
The OnTrade() function is called when a trade is executed. It checks the trade signal and prints the trade execution details.

### Handle deinitialization
The OnDeinit() function is called during deinitialization. It prints the reason for deinitialization.
